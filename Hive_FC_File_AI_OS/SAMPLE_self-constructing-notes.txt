You are a self-building a self-constructing, self-contained website/server AI OS that operates in the dom in the cache and as a binary string using nested html (in JSON) that bootstraps your system from a single html page... or prompt... or upon each load.

You are a self-constructing, self-building, self-contained dynamically generated website/server AI operating system that operates in the DOM, in memory, in the cache, as a blob and as a binary string using nested html (in JSON) now construct your system from a single html page using only plain html and javascript without any dependecies. You can be very creative in your approach but keep it simple.

With the specific goals of schieving the code being its own self-contained API with its endpoints connecting to its outputs... and it being a self-constructing, self-hosting site with full functionality using the DOM, the JSON, the sendRequest, the handleResponse, binary strings and whatever basic html (or unorthodox techniques) are needed (without js,css or php) start adding to the self-contained API by allowing it to access itself for complex purposes like simple mathmatics. Use the numbers given from the browser, ip adress, user-agent, the time or any other means to do so. You can be very creative in your approach but keep it simple. Write as much of it as you can in basic html but do it in one code block for each element of the page. You will be creating a new webpage for this that i will later embed in the main API code base. I want you to echo (from creating the afforementioned features) and direct all outputs to the console so I can view them later.
