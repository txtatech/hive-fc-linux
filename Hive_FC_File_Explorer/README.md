All required files are included in this repo.

The main entry point:

start.html


NOTES:

To chunk files located in the 'inputs' folder into JSON use:

hive_file_chunkerV2.py

This is not required but to test the integrity of the chunked files do:

hive_file_dechunkerV2.py

To create an html containing all chunked JSON files:

create_html.sh

The resulting JSON chunks are stored here:

chunky.html
